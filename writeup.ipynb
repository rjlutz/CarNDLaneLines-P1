    "## The goals / steps of this project are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Make a pipeline that finds lane lines on the road\n",
    "* Reflect on your work in a written report (this document!)\n",

    "### Reflection\n",

    "### 1. Description of my pipeline. \n",
    "\n",
    "My pipeline consisted of 5 steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Grayscale**: original image is converted to grayscale\n",
    "2. **Gaussian Blur**: the grayscale image is blurred with kernel size of 5 \n",
    "3. **Canny Edge Detection**: using gradient analysis, this step highlights all edges and masks other content\n",
    "4. **Region Masking**: based on the videos provided, a trapezoidal region is identified to filter unnecessary edges\n",
    "5. **Hough Transform**: edges which represent line features are identified\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Modifications to draw_lines()\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to draw a single line on the left and right 'lanes', I modified the provided draw_lines() function. The modified algorithm procedes as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Examine each line from the *Hough Transform* (step 5 above). In the code, I allow the consumer to specify a vertical line to serve as the partition boundary. All lines are then assigned to the left or right regions, according to their coordinates. Lines that cross the partition boundary are discarded. Lines which are extremely flat (absolute value of slope < 0.5), or extremely steep (absolute value of slope > 2) are discarded.\n",
    "* For each region (left and right), the total length of all lines is tallied for later use inweighting.\n",
    "* For each region, a weighted average is created of the slope and y-intercept of a representative line\n",
    "* Draw the line, extending its ends to the bottom of the screen and upper edge of the masked region (as specified in step 4 above)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Identify potential shortcomings with your current pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "The following shortcomings are observed or anticipated:\n",
    "\n",
    "The pipleline will not perform as well when a camera is attached off the centerline of the vehicle or when the camera has different properties (field of view, resolution, image aspect ratio, etc.). I observed this by recording my own driving footage and then testing the pipeline with that video. I have adapted my pipeline to isolate the relavant parameters and allow them to be set for each car/camera combination to mitigate some of this challenge. My videos are included in the ipynb file for thsi project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also observed when testing with my footage, the pipleline's output is interrupted when changing lanes,  driving through curves, driving through turns and riding over speedbumps. \n",
    "\n",
    "Other shortcomings are anticpated when the pipleine is used for video recorded under different lighting conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Suggest possible improvements to your pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "Possible improvements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Optimization: Further optimation of the pipeline may improve its processing time. Since the Canny algoritm already applies a convilution filter for blurring, its possible that the Guassian blur could be reduced or eliminated.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Apply a low pass filter. Deemphasizing transient fluctuations could provide a smoother set of red lines and help cross transitions like lane changes, turns, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Other reflections\n",
    "\n",
    "It was surprising (and rewarding!) to see how well the pipeline worked when some roads lacked a left or right lane marking. The pipeline picked up features like concrete drains and provided a lane marking anyway! You can see some examples in my NB unsder Custom Tests.\n"
